= Inspired from Ryan Bates Dot Files (https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install

You can then bootstrap your vim plugins by invoking :

  bootstrap_vim.sh

The plugins are managed with pathogen and Git submodules, can't be easier.
